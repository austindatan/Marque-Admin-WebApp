# MARQUE – USTP Event Attendance Monitoring System

**A USTP-CDO Event Attendance Monitoring System**

## Mobile Application

MARQUE is a mobile-based **Event Attendance Monitoring System** developed for the **University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP)**. The system streamlines event attendance tracking using QR codes, role-based access control, and real-time data processing to improve accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in university-wide events.

## About

The MARQUE Mobile Application is a core component of the MARQUE system, designed to provide reliable, real-time to near real-time updates on event attendance, participant verification, and system activity. It enables authorized users to manage events, record attendance, and generate reports using mobile devices connected to the internet.

The application reduces manual attendance processes while ensuring secure and role-based access to event data, in compliance with institutional data privacy principles.

## Key Features

1. QR Code Scanner for Attendance Logging
The system utilizes a QR code scanner to accurately record event attendance. This feature allows committees to scan participant QR codes in real time, ensuring fast, secure, and error-free attendance logging.

2. Downloadable Event Analytics and Reports
MARQUE provides downloadable event analytics files that summarize attendance data, participant statistics, and event performance. These reports can be used for documentation, evaluation, and decision-making purposes.

3. Feedback Collection Module
The system includes a feedback feature that allows participants to submit comments and evaluations after attending an event. This helps organizations assess event effectiveness and improve future activities.

4. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations
Authorized users can perform CRUD operations for managing events, users, organizations, and attendance records. This ensures flexible and efficient data management within the system.

5. Notification System
MARQUE features a notification module that informs users about upcoming events, attendance status, important updates, and system announcements in real time.
